# Rose & Crown English Pub – MS Stack Static Website Prototype

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of Project A for Net Zero Hosting.
It represents a static website prototype created within a simulated digital
agency environment where students act as junior developers working under
real deployment constraints.

This repository contains the Microsoft Stack implementation of the project,
built using a Microsoft-based AI-assisted development workflow.
